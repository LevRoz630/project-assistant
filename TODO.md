# TODO

## Planned Features

- [x] Give agent access to web
- [x] Connect with Joplin - integrate Joplin's REST API (Data API) as an alternative note storage backend to OneDrive
- [x] Connect with GitHub - track issues, PRs, commits
- [x] implement different instruction options for different functions
- [x] implement and check the safeguards against promt injection
- [x] Set Up Telegram connections
- [x] Integrate Arxiv summarization into launch on hte server (so it would run at the same time, not necessarily as part of the app, to be explored https://github.com/AutoLLM/ArxivDigest?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- [ ] Fix the connection to the st andrews email
- [x] Write wiki

- [ ] Investigate the best format against time and mental space exaustion. A reasonable strategy is intentional-friction, notification-light access: make the product usable only when the user has a concrete intent. Install safeguards?
