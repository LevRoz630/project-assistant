# TODO

## Planned Features

- [ ] Give agent access to web
- [x] Connect with Joplin - integrate Joplin's REST API (Data API) as an alternative note storage backend to OneDrive
- [ ] Connect with GitHub - track issues, PRs, commits
- [ ] Investigate different instruction options for different functions
- [ ] Investigate the safeguards against promt injection
- [ ] Set Up Whatsapp, Linkedin and Telegram connections
- [ ] Integrate Arxiv summarization into launch on hte server (so it would run at the same time, not necessarily as part of the app, to be explored https://github.com/AutoLLM/ArxivDigest?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- [ ] Fix the connection to the st andrews email

- [ ] A reasonable strategy is intentional-friction, notification-light access: make the product usable only when the user has a concrete intent, not as a feed. Concretely: (1) no infinite scroll / no home feed, only task- or question-driven entry points; (2) pull > push, i.e. scheduled summaries and explicit user queries instead of reactive notifications;
